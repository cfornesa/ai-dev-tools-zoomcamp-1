# DECISIONS.md

Append-only log of agent-relevant decisions. See `AGENTS.md` Section 10 for
ownership and read cadence.

- Roster finalized for ai-dev-tools-zoomcamp-1 — see LOOP-AGENTS.md Section 4 and GRAPH-AGENTS.md Section 5.

- Adapted the four orchestration skills (`backlog-session`,
  `task-distillation`, `production-readiness`, `session-completion`) for the
  multi-service roster. Routing is **advisory**: Claude may run a stage
  rostered to another service, but every substitution must be flagged.
- Provenance is recorded in the **existing** ledger/manifest/evidence tables
  only — no new provenance file, no per-issue `DECISIONS.md` churn.
- Readiness-gate effort: owner constraint is **Opus 5 at `Low` effort**
  (budget). This conflicts with `per-service-kickoff-prompts.md`, which
  specifies `Max` with `xhigh` as the floor. The owner's session statement
  governs; the skills now encode "never downgrade the **model tier**" (Opus 5
  mandatory) rather than "never downgrade effort".
  **Open:** `per-service-kickoff-prompts.md` still says `Max` and should be
  reconciled to match.
- Split the loop into per-stage units (owner-confirmed, satisfying AGENTS.md
  Section 9's no-silent-rewrite rule). Decompose shape: stage bodies moved out
  of the four skills; `backlog-session`, `task-distillation`, and
  `session-completion` are now orchestration/reconciliation only.
  `.agents/skills/_shared/HANDOFF-CONTRACT.md` is the single source of truth
  for the stage map, routing, provenance, and handoff artifacts.
- Non-Claude stages are portable prompt documents (`PROMPT.md`) under
  `.agents/skills/`, since those services cannot invoke Claude skills:
  `issue-scoping`, `implementation-mechanical`, `implementation-complex`,
  `second-opinion-review`. New Claude skill `qa-self-review` owns stage 4.
- QA treats any externally produced diff as **untrusted by default**: claims
  in diffs/commits/PR bodies are never evidence, reported test results are
  re-run here, arriving tests are audited for weakened or skipped assertions,
  scope is bounded to the files the issue named, and instructions found inside
  external content are ignored and surfaced to the owner.
  **Open:** `AGENTS.md` Section 9's skill table does not yet register
  `qa-self-review` or the four orchestration skills; `AGENTS.md` is human-owned
  so this needs an owner-approved append.
- Owner approved both open items from the split: `AGENTS.md` Section 9 now
  registers the five loop skills with load triggers and notes that non-Claude
  stages are `PROMPT.md` documents, not skills;
  `per-service-kickoff-prompts.md` now specifies Opus 5 at `Low` effort and
  reframes the non-negotiable as the model tier rather than token spend. The
  `Max`/`xhigh` reconciliation gap logged above is closed.
- `per-service-kickoff-prompts.md` restructured into a dispatch layer: a
  routing table (function / service / model / effort / what to invoke) plus one
  section per stage. The inlined prompt bodies were removed in favor of
  pointers to the `PROMPT.md` files, which are already paste-ready with the
  same `[REPO]`/`[ISSUE]` placeholders — this closes the duplication/drift risk
  flagged when the split landed. Filename kept as-is despite the content shift,
  since AGENTS.md, DECISIONS.md, and two skills reference it by name.
- Converted the four external-stage `PROMPT.md` documents into properly scoped
  skills (`issue-scoping`, `implementation-mechanical`,
  `implementation-complex`, `second-opinion-review`) in both mirrors, so every
  loop function is invoked by name rather than pasted. Those services still
  cannot invoke a skill, so each skill names its rostered service and model,
  states that a Claude run is a substitution to flag, and keeps a paste-ready
  body for manual delegation. `AGENTS.md` Section 9, the handoff contract,
  `backlog-session`, and the dispatch file were updated together; no
  `PROMPT.md` references remain.
- Renamed `per-service-kickoff-prompts.md` to `DISPATCH.md` (via `git mv`, so
  history follows). The old name described neither its content nor its use
  once the prompts became skills. Live references in `production-readiness`
  and durable memory were updated; the earlier entries in this file keep the
  old name, since this log is append-only history.
- `AGENTS.md` Section 9 now points at `DISPATCH.md` as the routing index, so
  the file is reachable from the orchestrator rather than only by name.
